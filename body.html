        <h1>What is Body Image?</h1>
        <p>All of these are classified as body image:</p>
        <div class="mainbody">        <ul>
            <li><span>you picture yourself in your mind</span> </li>
            <li>What you believe about your appearance</li>
            <li>How you feel about your body, height, weight, shape etc.</li>
            <li>How you feel in your body, not just about your body</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Body Image can be influenced by multiple factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comments from family, friends and others about our, their or other people's bodies</li>
            <li>Ideals projected by society or ourselves about physical appearance</li>
            <li>Frequency at which we compare ourselves to others/ideals</li>
            <li>Exposure to idealized bodies rather than normalized bodies</li>
            <li>The experience of abuse, including sexual, physical or emotional</li>
            <li>The experience of prejudice and discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, ablity, sexual orientation or gender identity</li>
            <li>Sensory experiences, including pleasure, pain and illness</li>

        <p>Body Image Awareness promotes healthy attitudes and behaviors regarding body image and focuses on providing preventative and educational information, as well as interactive resources, concerning disordered eating.

            Eating disorders affect both men and women with the rate of eating disorders rising among both genders to 4-10 percent and 10-20 percent, respectively.
            
            Disordered eating does not solely refer to Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS), but also refers to binge eating/compulsive overeating.</p>
